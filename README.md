- 👋 Hi, I’m @alarmclock-kisser // Dr Abgezüffelt // DJ Nasse Truye
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Creating / Optimizing code for problems which have no solution or implementation (yet).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python privately, C# .NET at work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... A full installer (binaries for DOS and UNIX) for Audio Processing on GPU, with drivers setup, pip libraries etc.
- 📫 How to reach me ... [instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/idontgotnovans/)
- 😄 Pronouns: ... "Der Gerät" - I could not care less, actually. I'd define "respect" having little to do with pronouns usage. Just call me Marcel.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I started coding when I was 12-ish with my best friend in Scratch, haha. We wanted to create a Mario level editor.
